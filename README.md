# WeBot Traiding Bot (Development not working)

Docker Trading Stock Bot

Idea to create a WeBull Trading Bot by shamelessly copying code and mashing it into a docker container. So far my I plan on using a mashup of Part Time Lary : TradeKit (https://github.com/hackingthemarkets/tradekit), Jacob Amaral: https://github.com/Jake0303/Webull-Trading-Bot and the API from: https://github.com/tedchou12/webull Also found piwi3910 very helpful because I'm pretty new to Docker and Python.
